# üîí TypeFlow: Advanced Runtime Type Safety in Python 

## üåü Project Overview

TypeFlow is an innovative Python library that introduces a novel approach to runtime type safety, providing developers with a powerful and expressive way to enforce type constraints and create more robust code.

## üöÄ Core Concept

The `Variable` class reimagines type management in Python by:
- Enforcing runtime type safety
- Introducing symbolic operators for type-controlled data transfers
- Providing a clean, intuitive interface for type-strict programming

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Strong Typing**: Ensure type integrity at runtime
- **Custom Operators**: Use `<<` for assignment and `>>` for value transfer
- **Flexible Type Support**: Works with built-in Python types
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Detailed type mismatch exceptions

## üîç Future Roadmap

- [ ] Support for complex types (generics)
- [ ] Integration with Python's `typing` module
- [ ] Advanced value constraints and validators
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] Comprehensive type inference mechanisms
